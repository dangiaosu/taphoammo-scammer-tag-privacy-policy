  <h1>Privacy Policy for TapHoaMMO Scammer Tag</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 28, 2025</p>
  <p>TapHoaMMO Scammer Tag ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension designed to display a "Scammer" tag with a reason next to seller names on taphoammo.net, helping users avoid potential scammers. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data in compliance with Chrome Web Store policies.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following data to provide the Extension's functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web History:</strong> The Extension accesses the URL of the current tab (e.g., https://taphoammo.net/danh-muc/...) to determine the type of page (category, user info, or product page) and display the "Scammer" tag accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> The Extension reads seller names on taphoammo.net pages to compare them with a scammer list and display a warning tag if a match is found.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-User Data:</strong> The Extension fetches a scammer list (usernames and reasons) from Google Apps Script APIs, which is provided by the developer and not derived from user data.</li>
    <li>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, address), health information, financial information, authentication information, personal communications, location, or user activity (e.g., clicks, keystrokes).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use and Process Data</h2>
  <p>The data we collect is used solely to fulfill the Extension's purpose of protecting users on taphoammo.net:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web History:</strong> The URL is used to identify the type of page (e.g., category, user info, product page) and apply the appropriate logic to display the "Scammer" tag.</li>
    <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> Seller names are compared with the scammer list to determine if a warning tag should be displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>Scammer List:</strong> The list fetched from Google Apps Script is stored locally and used to display warnings without requiring constant API calls.</li>
    <li>We do not use the collected data for any purpose unrelated to the Extension's functionality, such as advertising, analytics, or determining creditworthiness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We store the following data locally on the user's device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scammer List:</strong> The list of scammers (usernames and reasons) fetched from Google Apps Script is stored in Chrome Storage to enable offline functionality and reduce API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Last Updated Timestamp:</strong> A timestamp is stored in Chrome Storage to track when the scammer list was last updated (updated every 2 hours).</li>
    <li>No data is stored on external servers. All data remains on the user's device and is deleted when the Extension is uninstalled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share user data with any third parties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Extension does not transmit the collected data (URL or seller names) to any external servers or third parties.</li>
    <li>The scammer list is fetched from Google Apps Script APIs hosted by the developer, but no user data is sent to these APIs.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or transfer user data for any purpose, including advertising, analytics, or lending.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the data stored by the Extension:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is stored locally in Chrome Storage, which is managed by the Chrome browser and protected by its security mechanisms.</li>
    <li>The Extension does not transmit data over the internet except when fetching the scammer list from Google Apps Script APIs, which uses secure HTTPS connections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Since the Extension does not collect personally identifiable information, there are no user-specific data rights to manage. However:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove all locally stored data (scammer list and timestamp) from Chrome Storage.</li>
    <li>Users can contact us for any questions or concerns regarding data usage (see Contact Us section).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Extension's functionality or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage users to review this policy periodically.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
